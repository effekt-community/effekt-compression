## Description
This project implements Huffman coding and LZ77 compression algorithm on byte streams. It implements the LZSS version of LZ77. It is written in the effekt language, a research language developed at the *University of Tübingen*.

## First steps

After using this template, follow these steps to set up your project:

1. Set up your development environment:
   - Clone this repository locally.
   - Open it in VSCode.
   - Install the Effekt VSCode extension offered in the pop-up in the bottom right.

2. Customize the project:
   - Open `flake.nix` and update the project name and other relevant values (follow the comments).
   - Push your `flake.nix` file after the changes and see if the CI agrees.

3. Set-up auto-update CI:
   - Go to Settings -> Actions -> General and check "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"
     in order to get weekly Pull Requests on Tuesday that update the Effekt version in CI.
   - See the [CI](#ci) section for more details

3. Replace this `README` with your own!
   - Please link back to this repo if you can :)

## Useful commands

### Running the project

Run the main file:
```sh
effekt src/compress.effekt [SOURCE_FILENAME] [METHOD] [COMPRESS/DECOMPRESS] [OUTPUT_FILENAME]
```

Where:
- [SOURCE_FILENAME] is the path to the file we want to compress
- [METHOD] the compression method we want to use. Allowed values are `huffman` or `lzss`.
- [COMPRESS/DECOMPRESS] specification whether we want to compress or decompress. Allowed values are `compress` or `decompress`.
- [OUTPUT_FILENAME] path to the newly created file

Example usage:

```sh
effekt.sh src/compress.effekt --backend js --includes . -- README.md huffman compress test.bin
```

! This assumes we are currently in the project directory, otherwise absolute paths are needed !

Run the tests:
```sh
effekt src/test.effekt
```

Open the REPL:
```sh
effekt
```

Build the project:
```sh
effekt --build src/main.effekt
```
This builds the project into the `out/` directory, creating a runnable file `out/main`.

To see all available options and backends, run:
```sh
effekt --help
```

### Nix-related commands

While Nix installation is optional, it provides several benefits:

Update dependencies (also runs automatically in CI):
```sh
nix flake update
```

Open a shell with all necessary dependencies:
```sh
nix develop
```

Run the main entry point:
```sh
nix run
```

Build the project (output in `result/bin/`):
```sh
nix build
```

## Example projects using this template

- [`effekt-stm`](https://github.com/jiribenes/effekt-stm)
- This very project!

## Repository structure

- `.github/workflows/*.yml`: Contains the [CI](#ci) definitions
- `src/`: Contains the source code
  - `main.effekt`: Main entry point
  - `test.effekt`: Entry point for tests
  - `lib.effekt`: Library code imported by `main` and `test`
- `flake.nix`: Package configuration in a Nix flake
- `flake.lock`: Auto-generated lockfile for dependencies
- `LICENSE`: Project license
- `README`: This README file

## CI

Two GitHub Actions are set up:

1. `flake-check`:
   - Checks the `flake.nix` file, builds and tests the project
   - Runs on demand, on `main`, and on PRs
   - To run custom commands, add a step using:
     - `nix run -- <ARGS>` to run the main entry point with the given arguments
     - `nix develop -c '<bash command to run>'` to run commands in the correct environment

2. `update-flake-lock`:
   - Updates package versions in `flake.nix`
   - Runs on demand and weekly (Tuesdays at 00:00 UTC)
